Rotation Count (medium) \
Given an array of numbers which is sorted in ascending order and is rotated ‘k’ times around a pivot, find ‘k’.

You can assume that the array does not have any duplicates.

Solution \
This problem follows the Binary Search pattern. We can use a similar strategy as discussed in Search in Rotated Array.

In this problem, actually, we are asked to find the index of the minimum element. The number of times the minimum element is moved to the right will be equal to the number of rotations. An interesting fact about the minimum element is that it is the only element in the given array which is smaller than its previous element. Since the array is sorted in ascending order, all other elements are bigger than their previous element.

After calculating the middle, we can compare the number at index middle with its previous and next number. This will give us two options:

1. If arr[middle] > arr[middle + 1], then the element at middle + 1 is the smallest.
2. If arr[middle - 1] > arr[middle], then the element at middle is the smallest.

To adjust the ranges we can follow the same approach as discussed in Search in Rotated Array. Comparing the numbers at indices start and middle will give us two options:

1. If arr[start] < arr[middle], the numbers from start to middle are sorted.
2. Else, the numbers from middle + 1 to end are sorted.

Code \
Here is what our algorithm will look like:
```
def count_rotations(arr):
  start, end = 0, len(arr) - 1
  while start < end:
    mid = start + (end - start) // 2

    # if mid is greater than the next element
    if mid < end and arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1]:
      return mid + 1

    # if mid is smaller than the previous element
    if mid > start and arr[mid - 1] > arr[mid]:
      return mid

    if arr[start] < arr[mid]:  # left side is sorted, so the pivot is on right side
      start = mid + 1
    else:  # right side is sorted, so the pivot is on the left side
      end = mid - 1

  return 0  # the array has not been rotated


def main():
  print(count_rotations([10, 15, 1, 3, 8]))
  print(count_rotations([4, 5, 7, 9, 10, -1, 2]))
  print(count_rotations([1, 3, 8, 10]))


main()
```

Time complexity \
Since we are reducing the search range by half at every step, this means that the time complexity of our algorithm will be O(logN where ‘N’ is the total elements in the given array.

Space complexity \
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).

Problem 1 \
How do we find the rotation count of a sorted and rotated array that has duplicates too?

The above code will fail on the following example!

Solution\
We can follow the same approach as discussed in Search in Rotated Array. The only difference is that before incrementing start or decrementing end, we will check if either of them is the smallest number.
```
def count_rotations_with_duplicates(arr):
  start, end = 0, len(arr) - 1
  while start < end:
    mid = start + (end - start) // 2
    # if element at mid is greater than the next element
    if mid < end and arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1]:
      return mid + 1
    # if element at mid is smaller than the previous element
    if mid > start and arr[mid - 1] > arr[mid]:
      return mid

    # this is the only difference from the previous solution
    # if numbers at indices start, mid, and end are same, we can't choose a side
    # the best we can do is to skip one number from both ends if they are not the smallest number
    if arr[start] == arr[mid] and arr[end] == arr[mid]:
      if arr[start] > arr[start + 1]:  # if element at start+1 is not the smallest
        return start + 1
      start += 1
      if arr[end - 1] > arr[end]:  # if the element at end is not the smallest
        return end
      end -= 1
    # left side is sorted, so the pivot is on right side
    elif arr[start] < arr[mid] or (arr[start] == arr[mid] and arr[mid] > arr[end]):
      start = mid + 1
    else:  # right side is sorted, so the pivot is on the left side
      end = mid - 1

  return 0  # the array has not been rotated


def main():
  print(count_rotations_with_duplicates([3, 3, 7, 3]))


main()
```
Time complexity
This algorithm will run in O(logN) most of the times, but since we only skip two numbers in case of duplicates instead of the half of the numbers, therefore the worst case time complexity will become O(N).

Space complexity \
The algorithm runs in constant space O(1).
